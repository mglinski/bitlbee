Fire up your favourite IRC client and connect to localhost:6667,
and read the documentation (type help for a list of commands).

Have fun!

The /usr/share/doc/bitlbee/examples/ directory contains some programs and
scripts you might like or need. They're not really examples but it's quite
normal behaviour to put small contrib stuff like that in there.
