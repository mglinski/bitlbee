bitlbee (3.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * /etc/default/bitlbee is now deprecated and no longer used. Any local
    modifications to the following settings won't be automatically migrated:
    BITLBEE_PORT, BITLBEE_OPTS, BITLBEE_DISABLED, BITLBEE_UPGRADE_DONT_RESTART
  * The debian post-installation scripts no longer try to automatically assign
    an alternate port number if 6667 is being used by another service. Please
    set it explicitly in /etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf
